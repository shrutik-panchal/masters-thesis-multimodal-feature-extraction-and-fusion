# masters-thesis-multimodal-feature-extraction-and-fusion
Master’s thesis repository exploring multimodal feature extraction and fusion techniques using the NuScenes dataset. The work investigates representation learning across camera, LiDAR, and radar data, focusing on how feature design and fusion strategies impact downstream perception tasks in autonomous driving systems.
