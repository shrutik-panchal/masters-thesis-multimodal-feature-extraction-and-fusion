# Master’s Thesis: Multimodal Feature Extraction and Fusion 
### Title: Learning Feature Extraction Techniques To Encode Complex NuScenes Dataset

This repository contains materials related to my Master’s thesis completed as part of the **MSc in Information Technology (Data Analytics)** at **Deakin University**.

## Overview
This thesis explores multimodal feature extraction and fusion techniques using the **NuScenes dataset**, with a focus on how information from heterogeneous sensors such as camera, LiDAR, and radar can be encoded and combined for perception tasks in autonomous driving systems.

The work examines representation learning pipelines and feature-level fusion strategies, and studies how design choices influence downstream perception performance. The emphasis is on understanding system behaviour and methodological trade-offs rather than achieving state-of-the-art results.

## Repository Structure
- `thesis/` contains the final submitted Master’s thesis in PDF format  
- `notebooks/` contains experimental and exploratory Jupyter notebooks used during the research  
- `code/` contains supporting scripts for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model experimentation  
 

## Notes
The code included in this repository reflects the exploratory nature of applied academic research. Due to dataset licensing constraints, environment differences, and hardware limitations, full reproducibility is not guaranteed. This repository is intended for transparency and reference purposes rather than production use.
